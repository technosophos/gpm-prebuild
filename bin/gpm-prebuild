SYNOPSIS

    gpm-prebuild provides library pre-building support for Go libraries
    in your Godeps file.

    As Go projects get larger and larger, it is sometimes nice to speed up
    local compilation. One way of doing this is by prebuilding the supporting
    libraries in the GOPATH. And that is what this program does.

    Essentially, it reads the Godeps file and runs `go build` on packages
    referenced there.

    The resulting .a files are located in .godeps/pkg

LIMITATIONS

    This can only build packages with top-level source code.

USAGE
      $ gpm prebuild             # Pre-build everything in Godeps and Godeps-Git, alias of build
      $ gpm prebuild build       # Pre-build everything in Godeps and Godeps-Git
      $ gpm prebuild version     # Outputs version information
      $ gpm prebuild help        # Prints this message
      $ gpm prebuild clean       # Deletes existing prebuilds only from
                                 # the first path on GOPATH.
